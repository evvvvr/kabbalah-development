    <h1>Manifesto for Kabbalah Software Development</h1>

    <p>
    As God created everything that is destined to come into being through letters,</br>
    hence we shalt dutifully connect the essence of a business model with its physical form by drawing,</br>
    hewing, combining and interchanging the symbols of a programming language,</br>
    using the wisdom of forefathers unveiled in the Tree Of Sefirot and following the Limitless Light in the eternal cycle of the perfect software formation
